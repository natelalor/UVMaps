## UVMap
An iOS mobile app designed to help students from the University of Vermont find their classes. Whether you are a freshman or senior, there are hundreds of classrooms across campus. Performing similarly to all the maps apps - which we know and love - UVMap will bring that convenience to the UVM campus. 

The UI will be a conjunction with the design aspects of maps apps like Google Maps and Apple Maps, with specifics for UVM. It will also implement class schedules, giving students exactly where they need to go and when customized to their schedule.
